    "# Final Project: Plasma Sheath Formation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Plasma is the fourth state of matter; it forms when a gas is heated to such a degree that electrons become freed from their atoms.  It makes up over 99% of the observable universe and is relevant to a range of scientific and consumer applications. A few examples of plasma and its applications are[1]:\n",
    "- Lightning\n",
    "- Stars\n",
    "- Aurora\n",
    "- Fluorescent lightbulbs\n",
    "- Plasma televisions\n",
    "- Fusion reactors\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, I wrote a program that simulates an electrically neutral, collisionless plasma at thermal equilibrium in a vacuum, with the goal of demonstrating the formation of a plasma sheath. Because electrons are much lighter than ions, they have a higher initial speed within the plasma, which allows some electrons to escape, leaving behind a region with a net positive charge. This boundary region is called the sheath, where the charge imbalance results in an electric field that pushes ions out of the plasma while keeping electrons from escaping. The sheath regulates the rates at which the particles leave the plasma, with the rates eventually reaching an equilibrium[2]. Understanding the physics of plasma sheaths is important for applications such as fusion reactors and plasma propulsion engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, I focused on showing the formation of a sheath in a visually obvious way using Matplotlib figures. When considering project ideas, I knew I wanted to do a project with a visually appealing result, and I found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUyCjAwrTI) video of a sheath simulation, which I thought looked really nice while also covering a topic I was interested in, so I decided to see if I could replicate the simulation[3]. My program uses the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method to simulate the plasma, with calculations for the electric potential and particle motion performed using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Verlet integration. The final result is a GIF showing the distributions of particles and the structure of the electric field in the plasma."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The PIC method is the standard computational method used to simulate the motion of charged particles, so I immediately settled on using it to produce my simulation. My program involves a few main steps: first, it initializes the particles by calculating their initial velocities and arranging them uniformly in a disk; next, the step that the name particle-in-cell comes from, it calculates the charge density at each node of the grid that the simulation space is divided into; then, using the charge density, it calculates the electric potential at each node using Poisson's equation, which is solved using the Finite Difference Method (FDM); the electric field is then calculated from the potential and interpolated back onto the particle positions; next, the electric field is used to calculate each particle's acceleration, and the particle's new position, velocity, and acceleration are calculated using Verlet integration; finally, the Matplotlib package is used to generate a figure visualizing the plasma's behavior[4]."

    "The first step of my program's main section is shown below. This is the first function called in the main simulation loop, because it creates the particles and generates their starting positions and velocities. The positions are generated from a random number generator and placed within a circle centered at the center of the simulation box. The directional components of velocity for particles in a plasma at thermal equilibrium follow a normal distribution, so the particle velocities can simply be generated from a normal distribution, with the standard deviation sigma calculated as shown below, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the particles in the plasma, and m is the particle mass[5][6]:\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{m}}$$\n",
    "The components for position and velocity are placed into an n $\\times$ 2 numpy array, where n is the number of particles being simulated. When calculating the initial distance of each particle from the center, the square root of the random number is taken to avoid clumping the particles toward the center of the plasma disk[7]."

    "The next step in the PIC algorithm, done with the code shown below, is to assign the charge of the individual particles to their nearest grid point and calculate the charge density ($\\rho$) at each grid point. In my program, I create an Nx $\\times$ Nx array to store the charge value at each node on the grid, where Nx is the number of grid cells along each axis. I convert the position coordinates for each particle to grid coordinates using the formula $x_g = \\frac{x}{dx - 0.5}$, where x is the particle coordinate on the x-axis and dx is the size of each grid cell. Taking the floor of these values gives me the index of the lower-left node of the cell containing each particle. I then calculate the weight for each node based on the particle's distance from the node and create a mask to remove any particles that have left the simulation area or are directly on the boundaries from the density calculation. Finally, I use the np.add.at function to distribute the charge from each particle onto its surrounding four grid nodes based on the weight assigned to each node.

    "The simulation loop section of the program brings all of the previously defined functions and parameters together to produce the actual simulation and visualize the results. It starts by initializing the particles and the figure the results will eventually be displayed on, and then calculating the initial state of the plasma using the initialize_particles, calculate_density, solve_poisson, calculate_electric_field, and interpolate_field functions. It also calculates the values necessary to display the plots at $t=0$. Then, the update function goes through all of the previously discussed PIC steps, updating the particle data at each timestep, until a previously defined number of timesteps (total_frames) have been calculated. The update function also updates the plots for each timestep. I also have the function print the number of frames calculated, the real time required to calculate each timestep (using Python's time package), and a log of the number of electrons and protons remaining inside the simulation boundaries. Once the loop has been completed, the animation GIF is saved, with its name determined by the current system time of the device that ran the simulation (obtained using Python's datetime package)."

    "The figure shown above is one of my earlier simulation results, which shows the main issue I encountered when working on this project. From left to right, the plots show the Electron Density (electrons per $\\text{m}^2$), the Proton Density ($\\text{m}^{-2}$), and the strength of the electric field (V/m) at each point in the simulation space. As you can see at the beginning of the animation, instead of demonstrating the formation of a sheath, the electrons all immediately fly out into the simulation box, and the plasma immediately comes apart. Very quickly, there are no electrons left in the simulation. I tried a few different things when trying to figure out what was wrong with the simulation, mainly trying different calculation methods (Fast Fourier Transform) and boundary conditions, before I realized that what I was simulating seemed to be physically accurate, which meant there was something wrong with the conditions I was simulating. At that point, I realized that my mistake was leaving out a step in the PIC process, which I had previously thought I could avoid to make my program a bit simpler. The step I had left out was the macroparticle weighting process, where instead of simulating some number of real particles, you simulate some number of macroparticles, each of which has its charge and mass weighted so that it represents a very large number of real-world particles. This step allows you to simulate real-world conditions more accurately without slowing down your program by an extreme amount in an attempt to simulate billions or trillions of particles. The code I used to implement this change is shown below."

    "This illustrates the benefits that come with the full PIC method, particularly the macroparticle weighting. I was able to run the simulation shown above, representing the behavior of nearly one billion particles, in less than a minute. Attempting to run the code for one billion particles without weighting would be a disaster; it would take a ridiculous amount of time, if it ran at all. The method does come with some downsides, however. You can see during the initial part of the simulation that there are fluctuations in the electric field strength throughout the plasma, instead of a uniform, very low strength field as you might expect from an electrically neutral plasma. This error is a result of the PIC methods, where charges are assigned to grids, and the calculations are performed on the grid points, rather than on the continuous field of potential, charge density, etc. The error could be improved, but it would require more complex computational methods or a higher number of macroparticles. I ran the simulation shown below with one million macroparticles, and as you can see, it did not result in a significant improvement in the noise in the electric field.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My program demonstrates the formation of a sheath along the boundary of an electrically neutral, collisionless plasma in a vacuum. Understanding the behavior of sheaths is important for many applications of plasma physics, including nuclear fusion and plasma propulsion engines. The particle in cell methods allow for efficient simulation of very large numbers of particles without requiring large amounts of computational power (I ran these simulations on a laptop, and, excluding the simulation with one million macroparticles, they completed in less than a minute each). The nature of the grid methods used does introduce some error into the calculations and the results, but it does not significantly alter the outcome of the simulations, and it could be improved through a variety of changes, such as using a larger number of macroparticles, using a smaller grid cell size, or using higher-order interpolation methods. Some further improvements to the program could include using those methods that would decrease the error, increasing the resolution of the plots in the output animation, saving the simulation data to csv files for future use, calculating and displaying the real time that the simulation took to run, and calculating and displaying the total timespan of the simulation to increase clarity about the timescale shown."
